    "First worked on print_menu method by using for loop with enumerate function to traverse the tuple containing the details of menu items, price and quantity. To display the menu starting from index 1, added 1 to the key.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next worked on is_valid_login method by blocking the irrelevant code from the main() to check the output results for any errors. For this method, used while loop with condition count less than 3 by initiating count equal to zero at first and used input function to get userid and password details from the user. Next the program used if condition to check the userid exists in self.managers dictionary containing the managers userid and password details, if it exists then the program checks for the password matches the userid in self.managers, then print 'success' and sets that manager as self.current_manager in case of successful login. If the entered userid or password doesn't matches with key-value pair in self.managers, program prints 'Access denied Try again' and increases the count by 1 for every unsuccessful login. After three unsuccessful logins, program prints 'system closed due to incorrect tries!'\n",
    "\n",
    "Next worked on take_order method using update function on the self.items_ordered dictionary by taking item and quantity ordered as key-value pair into the empty dictionary. Checked for the output results for any errors by unblocking the relevant code in the main().\n",
    "\n",
    "Next worked on process_order by assigning 0 to subtotal and using for loop in self.items_ordered.items() to get the subtotal value of all items ordered by multiplying the item price with quantity for each item ordered.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next worked on print_sales_receipt method to display the order summary by using for loop to traverse the list of items ordered along with its price, quantity and item total. Next displays the sub total value using process_order function, tax amount by assigning 10% of subtotal value to tax and finally total amount by adding subtotal and tax values."
